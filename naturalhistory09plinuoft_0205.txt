and Cenchramis and Callicles and Cepis3 Chalco—
sthenes also did actors in comedy and athletes3
Daippus a Man using a Scraper3 Daiphron,
Damocritus and Daemon statues of philosophers.
Epigonus, who copied others in almost all the subj ects
already mentioned, took the lead with his Trumpet-

its Murdered Mother. Praise is given to Eubulus’s
VVoman in Admiration and to Eubulides's Person

Alcibiades and one of his mother Demarate,a repre-
sented as performing a sacrifice by torch-light.

made a bull, guaranteeing that if a man were shut
up inside it and a fire lit underneath the man would

for one purpose only, so that whoever sees them
may hate the hands that made them. Sthennis did
a Demeter, a Zeus and an Athene that are in the
Temple of Concord at Rome, and also W'eeping
