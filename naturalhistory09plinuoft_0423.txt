BOOK XXXV. mx. 202

LIX. Moreover there are other kinds of earth
with a special property of their own about which
we have spoken already, but the nature of which 111 72>
must again be stated here: soil taken from theV ‘²2'
island of Galata and in the neighbourhood of Clupea
in Africa kills scorpions, and that of the Balearic
Islands and Iviza is fatal to snakes.

 

Note however that the reading Aristidis in XXXV. 108 is
uncertain and that Nicomachus is not mentioned in lll.
Nicomachus had a son and pupil the younger Aristides (A. of
Thebes 98—100, 110) who was thus grandson of A. the elder.
The younger is named also in XXXV. 24, and VII. 126.
Pliny shows some confusion of the two.
