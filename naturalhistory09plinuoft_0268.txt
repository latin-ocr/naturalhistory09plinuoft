The group of two figures (representing Harmodius and
Aristogeiton) made by Antenor in bronze, set up at Athens in
510- 9 Β. C., was carried off by Xerxes in 480, and a new
bronze pair was made by Critius and Nesiotes and set up at
Athens in 477. Antenor' s group was found by Alexander in
Persia, and on his orders, it seems, one of his successore
c. 293- 2 restored it to Ath’ens3 part of the original base of
Critius' and Nesiotes' group, it seems, has now been found;
the marble group now at Naples is thought to be a Roman
copy of the same group and made in the 2nd cent. A. D. The
bearded head of Aristogeiton can be restored from a head 111
the X atican. Copies of this group can be seen on four Attio
vases of the first half of the fifth century B.c. (Beazley,
Jouvrn. of Hellen. Stad. LXVIII (1948), 28), and one of about
400 B.C. (W. Hahland, vasen um Meidios p. 6 and pl. 6a).
