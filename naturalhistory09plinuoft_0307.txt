primary state, and the next best produced when
white earth is added to the same liquor after the
first has been removed3 and every time this is
done the quality deteriorates, the liquid becoming
more diluted at each stage. The reason why the
dark purple of Pozzuoli is more highly praised than
that of Tyre or Gaetulia or Laconia, places which
produce the most costly pul-ples, is that it combines
most easily with hysginuma and madder which can-
not help absorbing it. The cheapest comes from
Canosa. The price is from one to thirty denarii per
lb. Painters using it put a coat of sandyx underneath
and then add a coat of dark purple mixed with egg,
and so produce the brilliance of cinnabar3 if they
wish instead to produce the glow of purple, they
lay a coat of blue underneath, and then cover this
with dark purple mixed with egg.

XXVII. Of next greatest importance after this is
indigo,b a product of India, being a slime that adheres
to the scum upon reeds. XVhen it is sifted out it is
black, but in dilution it yields a marvellous mixture
of purple and blue. There is another kind of it that
floats on the surface of the pans ⁰ in the purple dye-
shops, and this is the ‘ scum of purple.' People who
adulterate it stain pigeons’ droppings with genuine
indigo, or else colour earth of Selinus or ring—earth ἀ
with woad. It can be tested by means of a live coal,
as if genuine it gives off a brilliant purple flarne and
a smell of the sea while it smokes3 on this account
some people think that it is collected from rocks
on the coast. The price of indigo is 20 denarii per

⁶ Perhaps the vessels containing Tyrian purple.

whether it came from Selinus in Cilicia or Selinus in Sicily.
