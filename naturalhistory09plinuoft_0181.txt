BOOK XXXIV. ΧῙΧ. 55-57

Polycleitus of Sicyon‚“ pupil of Hagelades‚ made a Ponat-fetens
statue of the ‘Diadumenos' or Binding his Hair—
a youth, but soft-looking—famous for having cost
100 13161115, and also the ‘Doryphoros’ or Carry-
ing a Spear—-a boy, but manly-looking. He also
made what artists call a ‘ Canon ' or Model Statue,b
35 they draw their artistic outlines from it as
from a sort of standard, and he alone of man-
kind is deemed by means of one work of art to have
created the art itself.⁰ He also made the statue of
the Man using a Body—scraper (⁶ Apoxyomenos ')
and, in the nude, the Man Attacking with Spear‚
and the Two Boys Playing Dice, likewise in the nude,
known by the Greek name of Astragalz'zontes and now
,standing in the fore—court of the Emperor Titus— A.1›.79-81.
this is generally considered to be the most perfect
work of art in existence—and likewise 1116 Η6111165
11131 was once 31 Lysimachea3 Heracles3 the Leader
Donning 1115 Armour, which 15 31 Rome3 and Α1·16111011,ῡἰ
called the Man in the Litter. Polycleitus 15 deemed
10 have perfected this science of statuary and 10
have refined the 311 of carving sculpture, just 35
Pheidjas is considered 10 have revealed it. A dis-
covery that was entirely his own is the art of making
statues throwing their weight on one leg, although
Varro says these figures are of a square build and
almost all made 011 0116 model.

Myron, who was born at Eleutherae, was himself Mygqn.
