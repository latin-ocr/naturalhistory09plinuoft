on arches over steep pitcheS. T hus the earth carried
along in the stream slides down into the sea and the
shattered mountain is washed away3 and by this
time the land of Spain owing to these causes has
encroached a long way into the sea. The material

drawn out at such enormous labour in the former
kind of mining so as not to fill up the shafts is in §67-

this latter process washed out. The gold obtained by
means of an arrugiaa does not have to be melted,
but is pure gold straight away. In this process
nuggets are found and also in the shafts‚ even
weighing more than ten pounds. They are called
palagae or else palacurnae‚ and also the gold in very
small grains baluce. The gorse is dried and burnt
and its ash is washed on a bed of grassy turf so that
the gold is deposited on it. According to some
accounts Asturia and Callaecia and Lusitania produce
in this way 20,000 lbs. weight of gold a year, Asturia
supplying the largest amount. Nor has there been
in any other part of the world such a continuous
production of gold for so many centuries. We have
stated that by an old prohibiting decree of the
senate Italy is protected from exploitation3 other-
wise no country would have been more productive
in metals, as well as in crops. There is extant a
ruling of the censors relating to the gold mines of
Victumulae in the territory of Vercellae which pro-

use by painters; it is found on the surface of the
earth, and is of a gold colour‚ but is easily broken,
like looking-glass stone. Hopes inspired by it had
