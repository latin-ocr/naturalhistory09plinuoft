The ore is sometimes red, sometimes {ish-coloured.
It cannot be smelted except when combined with
lead or with the vein oflead, called galena,a lead ore,
which is usually found running near veins of silver
ore. Also when submitted to the same process of
firing‚ part of the ore precipitates as lead while the
silver Hoats on the surface, like oil on water.

Silver is found in almost all the provinces, but the
finest is in Spain, where it, as well as gold, occurs in
sterile ground and even in the mountains3 and
wherever one vein is found another is afterwards
found not far away. This indeed also occurs in the
case of almost every metal, and accounts it seems for
the word ‘metals ' used by the Greeks.b It is a
remarkable fact that the shafts initiated by Hannibal
all over the Spanish provinces are still in existence3
they are named from the persons who discovered
them3 one of these mines, now called after Baebelo,
furnished Hannibal with 300 pounds weight of silver
a day, the tunnelling having been carried a mile and
a half into the mountain. Along the whole of this
distance watermen are posted who all night and day
in spells measured by lanterns bale out the water
and make a stream. The vein of silver nearest the
surface is called ‘ the raw.' In early days the
excavations used to stop when they found alum,
and no further search was made; but recently the
discovery of a vein of copper under the alum has
removed all limit to men’s hopes. The exhalations ⁰
from silver mines are dangerous to all animals, but
specially to dogs. Gold and silver are more beautiful
the softer they are. It surprises most people that
silver traces black lines.
