for a lizard creeping towards him. Also two of his
statues expressing opposite emotions are admired,
his Man-on NVeeping and his Merry Courtesan.
The latter is believed to have been Phryne and
connoisseurs detect in the figure 'the artist’s love of
her and the reward promised him α by the expression
on the courtesan's face. The kindness also of
Praxiteles is represented in sculpture, as in the
Chariot and Four of Calamis he contributed the
charioteer, in order that the sculptor might not be
thought to have failed in the human figure although
more successful in representing horses. Calamis
himself also made other chariots, some with four
horses and some with two, and in executing the
horses he is invariably unrivalled: but—that it may
not be supposed that he was inferior in his human
figures—his Alcmena is as famous as that of any
other sculptor.

Alcamenes a pupil of Pheidias made marble figures,
and also in bronze a Winner of the Five Bouts‚
known by the Greek term meaning Highly Com-
mende(l‚⁶ but Polycleitus's pupil Aristides made
four-horse and pair-horse chariots. Amphicrates is
praised for his Leaena3 she was a harlot, admitted
to the friendship of Harmodius and Aristogeiton
because of her skill as a harpist‚ who though put to
the torture by the tyrants ⁶ till she died refused to
betray their plot to assassinate them. Consequently
the Athenians wishing to do her honour and yet
unwilling to have made a harlot famous, had a statue
made of a lioness, as that was her name, and to
indicate the reason for the honour paid her instructed
the artist to represent the animal as having no
tongue.
