with whom the statues of the gods are of that colour.
On that account we will investigate all the facts
concerning it more carefully.

XXXVII. Theophrastus α states that cinnabar
uas discoveied by an Athenian named Callias, 90
years before the a1ch0nshipb of Praxibulus at
Athens—this date works out at the 349th yetr of
our city, and that Callias was hoping that gold
could by firing be extracted from the red sand
found in silver mines3 and that this was the origin
of cinnabar, although cinnabar was being found
even at that time in Spain, but a hard and sandy
kind, and likewise in the country of the Colchi on a
certain inaccessible rock from which the natives
dislodged it by shooting javelins, but that this is
cinnabar of an impure quality whereas the best is
found in the Cilbian territory beyond Ephesus, where
the sand is of the scarlet 0010111· of the kermes-insect3
and that this is ground up and then the powder is
washed and the sediment that sinks to the bottom
is washed agaim and that there is a difference of
skill, some people producing cinnabar at the first
washing while with others this is rather weak and
the product of the second washing is the best.

XXXVIII. I am not surprised that the colour had
an important rank, for as far back as Trojan times
red ochre was highly valued, as evidenced by Homer,
who speaks· of it as a distinguished colour for ships,
although otherwise he rarely alludes to colours and
paintings. The Greek name for it is ‘miltos,' and
they 0311 minium ‘cinnabar.' This gave rise to a
mistake owing to the name ‘ Indian cinnabar,' for
that is the name the Greeks give to the gore ⁶ of a
snake crushed by the weight of dying elephants,
