BOOK XXXIII. xxu. 79—xxm. 81

attracted the Emperor Gaius Caligula, who was A.D.37—41.
extremely covetous for gold, and who consequently

gave orders for a great weight of it to be smelted;

and as a matter of fact it did produce excellent gold,

but so small a weight of it that he found himself a

loser by his experiment that was prompted by
avarice, although orpiment sold for 4 denarii a

pound3 and no one afterwards has repeated the
experiment.

XXIII. All gold contains silver in various pro-‘Electrum'
portions, a tenth part in some cases, an eighth in
others. In one mine only, that of Callaecia called
the Albucrara mine, the proportion of silver found
is one thirty-sixth‚ and consequently this one is more
valuable than all the others. VVherever the pro-
portion of silver is one-fifth, the ore is called
electrum ας grains of this are found in ‘ channelled ' cf. ἓ 68-
gold. An artificial electrum is also made by adding
silver to gold. If the proportion of silver exceeds
one-fifth, the metal produced offers no resistance on
the anvil. Electrum also held a high position in
old times, as is evidenced by Homer b who represents
the palace of Menelaus as resplendent with gold,
electrum, silvei· and ivory. There is a temple of
Athena at Lindus of the island of Rhodes in which
there is a goblet made of electrum, dedicated by
Helen3 history further relatcs that it has the same
measurement as her breast. A quality of electrum
is that it shines more brightly than silvei· in lamp-
light. Natural electrum also has the property of
detecting poisons3 for semicircles resembling rain-
bows run over the surface in poisoned goblets and
emit a crackling noise like fire, and so advertise the
presence of poison in a twofold manner.
