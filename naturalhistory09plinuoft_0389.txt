contracted with Lucullus to make a statue of Happi·
ness for 1 ‚‚OOO OOO sesterces, which was prevented by
the death of both parties α· , and that when a Knight
of Rome Octavius desn ed him to make a w ine- -bowl
he made him a model in plaster for the price of a
talent. He also praises Pasiteles, who said that
modelling was the mother of chasing and of bronze
statuary and sculpture, and who, although he was
eminent in all these arts, never made anything
before he had made a clay model. He also states
that this art. had already been brought to perfectiori
by Italy and especially by Etruria; that Vulca was
summoned from Veii to receive the contract from
Tarquinius Priscus for a statue of ,Jupiter to be
consecrated in the Capitol, and that this Jupiter
was made of clay and consequently was regularly
painted with cinnabar; and that the four—horse
chariots about which we spoke above on the pedi-
ment of the temple were modelled in clay3 and that
the figure of Hercules, which even to-day retains in
the city the name b of the material it is made of, was
the work of the same artist. For these were the
most splendid images of gods at that time3 and we
are not ashamed of those ancestors of ours for
w orshipping them in that material. For they used
not formerly to work up silv er and gold even for
gods. XL‘xI Statues of this kind are still to be
found at various places. In fact ex en at Rome and
in the Municipal Towns there are many pediments
of temples, remarkable for their carving and artistic
merit and intrinsic durability, mole 0‘deserying of
respect than gold, and certainly less baneful. At
the present day indeed, even in the midst of our
present rich resources the preliminary libation is
