part of the substance being separated out by the
flames and the blast and becoming attached in
proportion to its degree of lightness to the roof-
chambers and side-walls of the furnaces, the thinnest
being at the very mouth of the furnace, which the
flames have belched out3 it is called ‘ smoky cadmea ’
from its burnt appearance and because it resembles
hot white ash in its extreme lightness. The part
inside is best, hanging from the vaults of the roof-
chamber‚ and this consequently is designated ‘ grape-
cluster cadmea '1 this is heavier than the preceding
kind but lighter than those that follow—it is of two
colours‚ the inferior kind being the colour of ash and
the better the colour of pumice—and it is friable‚
and extremely useful for making medicaments for
the eyes. A third sort is deposited on the sides of
furnaces, not having been able to reach the vaults
because of its weight3 this is called in Greek
‘placitis,' ‘caked residue‚' in this case by reason
of its flatness, as it is more of a crust than pumice,
and is mottled inside3 it is more useful for itch-
scabs and for making wounds draw together into a
scar. Of this kind are formed two other varieffies,
onychitis which is almost blue outside but inside like
the spots of an onyx or layered quarm, and ostracitis
' ‘ shell-like residue ' which is all black and the dirtiest
of any of the kinds3 this is extremely useful for
wounds. All kinds of cadmea (the best coming from
the furnaces of Cyprus) for use in medicine are
heated again on a fire of pure charcoal and‚ when it
has been reduced to ash, if being prepared for plasters
it is quenched with Amminean wine, but if intended
for itch-scabs with vinegar. Some people pound it
and then burn it in earthenware pots, wash it in
