from Sardinia, is only used for white fabrics‚ and is of
no use for cloths of various colours; it is the cheap-
est of all the Cimolus kinds3 more valuable are
the Umbrian and the one called ⁴ rock.’ α The
peculiarity of the latter is that it increases in size
when it is steeped in liquid; consequently it is sold
by weight, whereas Umbrian is sold by measure.
Umbrian earth is only employed for giving lustre to
cloths. It will not be out of place to touch on
this part of the subject also, as a Metilian law refer-
ring to fullers still stands‚ the law which Gaius
Flaminius and Lucius Aemilius as censors put forward
to be carried in parliament: so careful about every-
thing were our ancestors. The process then is this:
the cloth is first washed with earth of Sardinia, and
then it is fumigated with sulphur, and afterwards
scoured with Cimolian earth provided that the
dye is fast3 if it is coloured with bad dye it is
detected and turns black and its colour is spread by
the action of the sulphur3 whereas genuine and
valuable colours are sostened and brightened up
with a sort of brilliancc by Cimolian earth when
they have been made sombre by the sulphur. The
‘ rock ' kind is more serviceable for white garments,
after the application of sulphur, but it is very detri-
mental to colour. In Greece they use Tymphaea
gypsum instead of Cimolian earth.

silversmiths' powder as used for polishing silver3⁶a

but the most inferior kind is the one which our
ancestors made it the practice to use for tracing
the line indicating victory in circus-races and for
marking the feet of slaves on sale that had been
imported from over-seas; instances of these being
