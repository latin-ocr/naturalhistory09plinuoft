IN TRODUCTION

BooKs XXXIII, XXXIV, and XXXV of Pliny's
Natural History contain interesting accounts of
minerals and mining and of the history of art.

Mr. H. Rackham left when he died a translation
in typescript with a few footnotes. The Latin text
has been prepared by Prof. E. H. XVarmington, who
has also added the critical notes on this text, many
footnotes on the translation, and marginal helps.
Some parts of the translation were completely
re-written by him. The sections on Greek art were
read and criticised by Prof. T. B. L. Webster‚ to
whom thanks are now duly rendered.

The codices cited in the critical notes on the Latin
text are as follows: Β = Bambergensis3 cd. Leid.
