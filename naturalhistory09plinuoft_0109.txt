as good, while if it turns red it is of the next quality,
and if black it has no value at all. But fraud has
found its way even into this test 3 if the shovels are
kept in men's urine the silver shaving is stained by
it during the process of being burnt, and counter-
feits whiteness. There is also one way of testing
polished silver in a man's breath—if it at once forms
surface moisture and dissipates the vapour.

XLV. It has been believed that only the best ee

silver is capable of being beaten out into plates u
and producing an image. This was formerly asic

sound test, but nowadays this too is spoiled by fraud.

Still, the property of reflecting images is marvel-
lous3 it is generally agreed that it takes place owing
to the repercussion of the air which is thrown back
into the eyes. In a similar way, owing to the same
force, in employing a mirror if the thickness of the
metal has been polished and beaten out into a slightly
concave shape the size of the objects reflected is
enormously magnified: such a difference does it
make whether the surface welcomes a the air in
question or flings it back.b Moreover bowls can be
made of such a shape, with a number of looking-
glasses so to speak beaten outward inside them,
that if only a single person is looking into them a
crowd of images is formed of the same number as the
facets in question. Ingenuity even devises vessels
that do conjuring tricks, for instance those deposited
as votive offerings in the temple at Smyrna: this is
brought about by the shape of the material, and it
makes a very great difference whether the vessels
are concave and shaped like a bowl or convex like a
Thracian shield, whether their centre is recessed or
proj ecting, whether the oval ⁰ is horizontal or oblique,
