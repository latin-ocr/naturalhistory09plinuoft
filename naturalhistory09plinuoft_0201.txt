represented in bronze not a human being but anger
personified. Silanion also made a famous Achilles,
and also a Superintendent Exercising Athletes;
Strongylion made an Amazon, which from the
remarkable beauty of the legs is called the Eucnemon,
and which consequently the emperor Nero caused to
be carried in his retinue on his journeys. The same
sculptor made the figure rendered famous by Brutus
under the name of Brutus’s Boy because it
represented a favourite of the hero of the battles at 42 ss.o.
Philippi. TheodorUS‚ who constructed the Labyrinth a
at Samos, cast a statue of himself in bronze. Besides
its remarkable celebrity as a likeness, it is famous
for its very minute workmanship3 the right hand
holds a file, and three fingers of the left hand origin-
ally held a little model of a chariot and four, but this
has been taken away to Palestrina as a marvel of
smallness: if the team were reproduced in a picture
with the chariot and the charioteer, the model of 3
fly, which was made by the artist at the same time,
would cover it with its wings. Xenocrates, who was
a pupil of Tisicrates‚ or by other accounts of
Euthycrates surpassed both of the last mentioned
in the number of his statues3 and he also wrote
books about his art.

Several artists have represented the battles of
Attalus b and Eumenes against the Gauls, Isigonus,
Pyromachus, Stratonicus and Antigonus, who wrote
books about his art. Boethus did a Child ⁶ Strangling
a Goose by hugging it, although he is better in silver.
And among the list of works I have referred to all
the most celebrated have now been dedicated by the

⁶ Attalus Ι of Pergamum, who dealt with Gallic invaders of
Asia Minor between 240 and 232 B.c. ⁰ Copies exist.
