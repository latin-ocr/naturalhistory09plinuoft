The purport of placing statues of men on columns
was to elevate them above all other mortals; which
is also the meaning conveyed by the new invention
of arches. Nevertheless the honour originally began
with the Greeks, and I do not think that any person

them down again at the entrance of Sulla.

not enough for her to be clad in a toga, although
statues were not voted to Lucretia and Brutus, who
had driven out the kings owing to whom Cloelia had

should have held the view that her statue and that of
Cocles were the first erected at the public expense-—
for it is probable that the monuments to Attus and

of Piso that the statue of Cloelia also was erected by
the persons who had been hostages with her, when
they were given back by Porsena, as a mark of
honour to her3 whereas on the other hand Annius
Fetialis states that an equestrian figure which once
