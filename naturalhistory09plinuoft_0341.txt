subject might be thought instead to be absent in the
picture, and he only showed the part of the face
which he was able to display as unmutilated. Among
his works there are also pictures of persons at the
point of death. But it is not easy to say which of his
productioris are of the highest rank. His Aphrodite
emerging from the Sea was dedicated by his late
lamented MaJesty Augustus in the Shrine of his
father Caesar3 it is known as the Anadyomene3
this like other works is eclipsed α yet made famous
by the Greek verses which sing its praises; the
lower part of the picture having become damaged
nobody could be found to restore it, but the actual
injury contributed to the glory of the artist. This
picture however suffered from age and rot, and Nero
when emperor substituted another for it, a work by
Dorotheus. Apelles had also begun on another
Aphrodite at Cos, which was to surpass even his
famous earlier one3 but death grudged him the

be found to carr) on the task, in conformity with the
outlines of the sketches prepa1·.ed He also painted
Alexander the Great holding a Thundeibolt, in the
temple of Artemis at Ephesus, for a fee of twenty
talents in gold. The fingers have the appearance
of projecting from the surface and the thunderbolt
seems to stand out from the picture—readers must
remember b that all these effects were produced by
four colours; the artist received the price of this
picture in gold coin measured by weiglit,⁶ not

‘² ‘ Overcome ' or ⁶ surpassed ³ by the poet, who can express
more than the painter can3 for the painter can represent one
moment only. θ See ξ 50.

01t is suggested that this means that the price was the
equivalent (in gold coins) of the weight of the panel.
