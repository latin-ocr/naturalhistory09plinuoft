lead (tin) is the most valuable3 the Greeks applied
to it the name cassiteras, and there was a legendary
story of their going to islands of the Atlantic ocean to
fetch it and importing it in platted vessels made of
osiers and covered with stitched hides. It is now
known that it is a product of Lusitania and Gallaecia
found in the surface-strata of the ground which is
sandy and of a black colour. Itis only detected by its
weight, and also tiny pebbles ofit occasionally appear,
especially in dry beds of torrentS. The miners wash
this sand and heat the deposit in furnaces. It is
also found in the goldmines called ‘ alutiae,' through
which a stream of water is passed that washes out
black pebbles of tin mottled with small white spots,
and of the Same weight as gold, and consequently
they remain with the gold in the bowls b in which
it is collected, and afterwards are separated in the
fornaces, and fused and melted into white lead.
Black lead does not occur in Gallaecia, although the
neighbouring country of Bisca 5 a has large quantities
of black lead only3 and white lead 3ields no sllv er

white lead, nor can white be soldered to black with-

white without some black lead. Homer testifies ll XI,
