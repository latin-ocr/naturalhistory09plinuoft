it keeps its colour. I find that it is also adulterated
with lime, and this can be detected in a similar way
with a sheet of red-hot iron if there is no gold avail-
able. A surface painted with cinnabar is damaged
by the action of sunlight and moonlight. The way
to prevent this is to let the wall dry and then to coat
it with Punic wax melted with olive oil and applied
by means of brushes of bristles while it is still hot,
and then this wax coating must be again heated by
bringing near to it burning charcoal made of plant-
galls, till it exudes drops of perspiration, and after-
wards smoothed down with waxed rollers and then
with clean linen cloths‚ in the way in which marble
is given a shine. Persons polishing cinnabar in
workshops tie on their face loose masks of bladder—
skin‚ to prevent their inhaling the dust in breathing,
which is very pernicious, and nevertheless to allow
them to see over the bladders. Cinnabar is also used
in writing books, and it makes a brighter lettering
for inscriptions on a wall or on marble even in tombs.

XLI. Of secondary importancea is the fact that
experience has also discovered a way of getting
hydrargyrum or artificial quicksilver as a substitute
for‘ real quicksilver3 we postponed the description

of this a little previously. It is made in two ways, §§64‚ 100.

by pounding red-lead in vinegar with a copper
pestle in a copper mortar, or it is put in an iron shell
in flat earthenware pans‚ and covered with a convex
lid smeared on with clay, and then a fire is lit under
the pans and kept constantly burning by means of
bellows‚ and so the surface moisture (with the colour
of silver and the fluidity of water) which forms on the
lid is wiped off it. This moisture is also easily
divided into drops and rains down freely with slippery
