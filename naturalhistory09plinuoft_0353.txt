battering down of walls, looked on at the work of an
artist. And even to this day the story is attached to
a picture of that date that Protogenes painted it
with a sword hanging over him. The picture is the
one of a Satyr, called the Satyr Reposing‚ and to
give a final touch to the sense of security felt at the
time, the figure holds a pair of flutes.

Other works of Protogenes were a Cydippe, a
Tlepolemus, 3 Philiscus the Tragic Poet in Medita—
tion, an Athlete, 3 portrait of King Antigonus, and
one of the Mothera of Aristotle the philosopher.
Aristotle used to advise the artist to paint the
achievements of Alexander the Great, as belonging
to history for all time. The impulse of his mind
however and 3 certain artistic capi-iciousness led him
rather to the subjects mentioned. His latest works
were pictures of Alexander and of Pan. He also
made bronze statues, as we have said.

In the same period there was also Asclepiodorus,
who was admired by Apelles for his proportions. For
a picture of the Twelve Gods the tyrant Mnaso paid
him three hundred minae per god. The same patron
paid Theomnestus twenty minae for each of the
heroes in a picture.

To the list of these artists must also be added
Nicomachus son and pupi] of A1·istides.b He painted
a Rape of Persephone, a picture formerly ⁰ in the
Shrine of Minerva on the Capitol, just above the
Chapel of Youth3 and there was also in the Capitol,
where it was placed by Genera] Plancus‚d his Victory
hurrying her Chariot aloft. He was the first painter
who represented Odysseus wearing a felt skull-cap.
He also painted an Apollo and Artemis, and the
Mother e of the Gods seated on a Lion, and likewise
