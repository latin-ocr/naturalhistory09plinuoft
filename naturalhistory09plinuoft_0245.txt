closely allied to lead, others a brittle and coppery
kind that is specially to be avoided for the require-
ments of wheels and for nails, for which purpose the
former quality is suitable; another variety of iron
finds favour in short lengths only and in nails for
soldiers’ boots3 another variety experiences rust
more quickly. All of these are called ‘stricturae‚'
‘ edging ores,’ a term not used in the case of other
metals3 it is, as assigned to these ores, derived from
stringere aciem, ⁴ to draw out a sharp edge.' There is
also a great difference between smelting works. and
a certain knurr of iron is smelted in them to give
hardness to a blade, and by another process to gii’ing
solidity to anvils or the heads of hammers. But the
chief difference depends on the water in Which at
intervals the red hot metal is plunged3 the water
in some districts is more serviceable than in others,
and has made places famous for the celebrity of their
iron, for instance Bambola and Tarragona in Spain
and Como in Italy, although there are no iron mines
in those places. But of all varieties of iron the
palm goes to the Serio, sent us by the Seresa with
their fabrics and skins. The second prize goes to
Parthian i10n3 and indeed no other kinds of iron
are forged from pure metal‚ as all the rest have a
softer alloy w elded with them. In our part of the
world in some places the lode supplies this good
quality, as for instance in the country of the Norici,
in other places it is due to the method of working,
as at Sulmona‚ and in others, as we have said, it is due ς 144.
to the water3 inasmuch as for giving an edge there
is a great difference between oil whetstones and
water whetstones, and a finer edge is produced by
oil. It b is the custom to quench smaller iron forgings
