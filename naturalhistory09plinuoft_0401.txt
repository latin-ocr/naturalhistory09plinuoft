Mausolus α at Halicarnassus, buildings still standing. 377-353 ae.
Murena and Varro in their aedileship had some
plaster work on brick walls at Sparta cut away,
and because of the excellence of its painting had
it enclosed in wooden frames and brought to Rome
to decorate the Assembly-place. It was in itself a
wonderful piece of work, yet its transfer caused even
more admiration. In Italy also there is a brick wall
at Arezzo and at Mevania. Structures of this sort
are not erected in Rome, because an eighteen-inch
wall will only carry a single storey, and there is a
regulation forbidding any partition exceeding that
thickness: nor does the system used for party-walls
permit of it.

famous is on the island of Melos. Itis also found ln
Italy, in the territory of Naples and Campania, on
the hills called the Leucogaei. It is there dug out of
mine-shafts and dressed with fire. There are four
kinds: live sulphur, the Greek name for which
means ‘untouched by fire,’ which alone forms as a
solid mass—for all the other sorts consist of liquid
and are prepared by boiling in oil; live sulphur is
dug up, and it is translucent and of a green colour;
it is the only one of all the kinds that is employed
by doctorS. The second kind is called ‘ clod-
sulphur,' and is commonly found only in fullers'
