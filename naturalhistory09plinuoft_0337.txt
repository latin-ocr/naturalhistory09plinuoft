in his criticism must not go beyond the sandal—
a remark that has also passed into a proverb.‘¹ In

which made him more agreeable to Alexander the
Great, who frequently visited his studio—for, as we
have said, Alexander had published an edict for-

about painting without any real knowledge of it,
and Apelles would politely advise him to drop the
subject, saying that the boys engaged in grinding
the colours were laughing at him: so much power
did his authority exercise over a King who was
otherwise of an irascible temper. And yet Alexander
conferred honour on him in a most conspicuous
instance3 he had such an admiration for the beauty
of his favourite mistress, named Pancaspe, that he
gave orders that she should be painted in the nude
by Apelles, and then discovering that the artist
while executing the commission had fallen in love
with the woman, he presented her to him, great·
minded as he was and still greater owing to his control
os himself, and of a greatness proved by this action
as much as by any other victory: because he
conquered himself, and presented not only his
bedmate but his affection also to the artist, and was
not even influenced by regard for the feelings of
his fav0urite in having been recently the mistress of a
monarch and now belonged to a painter. Some
persons believe that she was the model from which
the Aphrodite Anadyomene (Rising from the Sea)
was painted. It was Apelles also who, kindly among
his rivals‚ first established the reputation of
