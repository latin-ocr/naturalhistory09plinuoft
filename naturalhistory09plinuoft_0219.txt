The flow er bof copper also is useful as a medicine.

It is made by fusing copper and then transferring
it to other furnaces, where 3 faster use of the

off other scales of copper of 3 similar red hue—this
scale is called by the Greek word meaning ‘ husk '——
and by this process the flower is adulterated‚ so that
the scale is sold as a substitute for it. On the other
hand, scale of copper is forcibly knocked off

bolts into which are welded cakes of the metal,
specially in the factories of Cyprus. The whole

difference is that the scale is detached from the cakes
by successive hammerings, whereas the flower falls
off of its own accord. There is another finer kind
of scale, the one knocked off from the down-like sur-
face of the metal, the name for which is ‘ stomoma.'

XXV. But of all these facts the doctors, if they
will permit me to say so, are ignorant—they are
governed by names: so detached they are from
the process of making up drugs, which used to be
the special business of the medical profession. Now-
¹adays whenever they come on books of prescriptions,
wanting to make up some medicines out of them,
which means to make trial of the ingredients in the
prescriptions at the expense of their unhappy

adulterations‚ and for a long time they have been
