impossible to overcome. They attack it with iron
wedges and the hammer-machines mentioned above ;
and it is thought to be the hardest thing that exist3‚
except greed for gold, which is the most stubborn of
all things. XVhen the work is completely finished,
beginning with the last, they cut through, at the
topS, the supports of the arched roofs. A crack

He by shout and gesture gives the order for the

Another equally laborious task involving even
