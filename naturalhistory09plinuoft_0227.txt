also obtained by seraping a copper ore of which we
shall now speak.

XXIX. Chalcitis‚ ‘copper-stone‚' is the name of chalcitis.
an ore,‘¹ that from which copper also, besides cadmea,
is obtained by smelting. It differs from cadmea
because the latter is quarried above ground, from
rocks exposed to the air, whereas chalcitis is obtained
from underground beds, and also because chalcitis
becomes immediately friable‚ being of a soft nature,
so as to have the appearance of congealed down.
There is also another difference in that chalcitis
contains three kinds of mineral‚ copper‚ misy b and
sori‚⁰ each of which we shall describe in its p130<33§§120,121.
and the veins of copper in it are of an oblong shape.
The approved variety of chalcitis is honey coloured,
and streaked with fine veins, and is friable and not
stony. It is also thought to be more useful when
fresh, as when old it turns into sori. It is used for
growths in ulcers‚ for arresting haemorrhage and,
in the form osa powder, for acting as an astringent
on the gums‚ uvula and tonsils, and, applied in wool,
as a pessary for affections of the uterus, while with
leek juice it is employed in plasters for the genitals.
It is steeped for forty days in vinegar in an earthen-
ware jar, covered with dung, and then assumes the
colour of saffron3 then an equal weight of cadmea is
mixed with it and this produces the drug called
psoricon or cure for itch. If two parts of chalcitis
are mixed with one of cadmea this makes a stronger
form of the same drug, and moreover it is more violent
if it is mixed in vinegar than if in wine; and when
roasted it becomes more effective for all the same
purposes.

XXX. Egyptian sori is most highly commended, sm.
