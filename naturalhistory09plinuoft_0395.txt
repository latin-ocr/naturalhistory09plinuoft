BOOK XXXV. xnvl. 165-xm11. 167
The priests of the Mother a of the Gods called Galli

castrate themselves, if we accept the account of
Marcus Caelius, with a piece of Samian pottery,
the only way of avoiding dangerous results, and
Caelius proposed as a penalty for an abominable
offe-nce that the guilty person should have his tongue
cut out in the same way, just as if he were already
himself inveighing against the same Vitellius in
anticipation. What is there that experience cannot
devise? For it employs even broken crockery,
making it more solid and durable by pounding it up
and adding what is called Segni lime, a kind of
material used in a method which experience has also
invented for making pavements.

XLVII. But there are other inventions also that
belong to Earth herself. For who could sufficiently
marvel at the fact that the most inferior portion of
the earth's substance, which is in consequence
designated dust,‘> on the hills of Pozzuoli, encounters
the waves of the sea and as soon as it is submerged
turns into a single mass of stone that withstands the
attacks of the wax es and becomes stronger every
day, especially if it mixed with broken quairy- -stone
from Cumae? In the Cyzicus district also the nature
of the earth is the same, but there not dust but the
earth itself is cut out in blocks of any size wanted
and plunged into the sea, and when drawn out, it is
of the consistency of stone The same is said to take
place in the neighbourhood of Cassandrea, and it is
stated that in a fresh w ater spiing at Cnidus earth
becomes petrified in less than eight months. Or
the coast d from Oropus to Aulis all the earth that
the sea touches is turned into rocks. The finest,
portion of the sand from the Nile is not very different
