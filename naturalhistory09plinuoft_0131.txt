painting, price two sesterces a pound, while that
called clear ochre, coming from Gaul, costs two
asses less. This and the Attic kind they use for
painting different kinds of light, but only marbled

The custom of using yellow ochre for painting was
first introduced by Polygnotus and Micon, but they
