BOOK XXXIV. xxxvm. 137·xxx1x. 139

known to me, but I will put down the actual words
of the elder Messala ‘² on the subject. ‘ The family
of the Servilii has a holy coin to which every year
they perform sacrifices with the greatest devotion
and splendour; and they say that this coin seems to
have on some occasions grown bigger and on other
occasions smaller, and that thereby it portends either
the advancement or the decadence of the family.’

XXXIX. Next an account must be given of the
mines and ores of iron. Iron serves as the best and
the worst part of the apparatus of life, inasmuch as
with it we plough the ground, plant trees, trim the
trees that prop our vines, force the vines to renew
their youth yearly by ridding them of decrepit growth 3
with it we build houses and quarry rocks, and we
employ it for all other useful purposes‚ but we
likewise use it for wars and slaughter and brigandage‚
and not only in hand-to-hand encounters but as a
winged missile, now projected from catapults, now
hurled by the arm, and now actually equipped with
feathery wings, which I deem the most crimina]
artifice of man’s genius, inasmuch as to enable death
to reach human beings more quickly we have taught
iron how to fly and have given wings to it. Let us
therefore debit the blame not to Nature, but to man.
A number of attempts have been made to enable
iron to be innocent. We find it an express provision
included in the treaty granted by Porsena to the
Roman nation after the expulsion of the kings that
they should only use iron for purposes of agriculture ;
and our oldest authors have recorded that in those
days it was customary to write with a bone pen.
