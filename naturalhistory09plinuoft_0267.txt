the vinegar‚ till the whole of it is used up. The stuff
scraped off is ground up and sifted and heated in
shallow vessels and stirred with small rods till it
turns red and becomes like sandaraclc, realgar.“
Then it is washed with fresh water till all the cloudy
impurities have been removed. Afterwards it is
dried in a similar way and divided into tablets. Its
properties are the same as those of the substances
mentioned above, only it is the mildest of them all,
and beside that, it is useful for giving women a fair
complexion3 but like scum of silver, it is a deadly
poison. The lead acetate itself if afterwards melted
becomes red.

LV. Of realgar also the properties have been
almost completely described. It is found both in
goldmjnes and silvermines3 the redder it is and the
more it gives off a poisonous scent of sulphur and the
purer and more friable it is, the better it is. It acts
as a cleanser‚ as a check to bleeding, as a calorific
and a caustic‚ being most remarkable for its corrosive
property; used as a liniment with vinegar it removes
fox-mange3 it forms an ingredient in eye-washes,
and taken with honey it cleans out the throat. It
also produces a clear and melodious voice, and mixed
vm'th turpentine and taken in the food, is an agree·
able remedy for asthma and cough; its vapour also
remedies the same complaints if merely used as a
fumigation with cedar wood.

LVI. Orpiment b also is obtained from the same
substance. The best is of a colour of even the
finest—coloured gold, but the paler sort or what
resembles sandarach is judged inferior. There is
also a third class which combines the colours of gold
and of sandarach. Both of the latter are scaly, but
