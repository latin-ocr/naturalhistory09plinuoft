clear, not even members of the Roman senate had
gold rings, inasmuch as rings were bestowed officially
on men about to go as envoys to foreign nations,
and on them only, the reason no doubt being that
the most highly honoured foreigners were recognized
in this way. Nor w as it the custom for any others
to w ear a gold ring than those on whom one liad been
officially bestowed for the reason stated3 and
customarily Roman generals went in triumph with-
out one, and although a Tuscan crown of gold was
held over the victor’s head from behind, nevertheless
he wore an iron ring on his finger when going in
triumph, just the same as the slave holding the
crown in front of himself. This was the way in
which Gaius Marius celebrated his triumph over
Jugurtha, and it is recorded that he did not assume
a gold ring till his third tenure of the consulship.
Those moreover who had been given gold rings
because they were going on an embassy only wore
them in public, but in their homes wore iron rings3
this is the reason why even now an iron ring and
what is more a ring without anyv stone in it is senta
as a gift to a woman when betrothed. Indeed I
do not find that any ringis were worn in the Trojan
period3 at all events Homer nowhere mentions
thern, although he shows that tablets b used to be
sent to and fro in place of letters, and that clothes
and gold and silver vessels were stored away in
chestsc and were tied up with signet-knots‚ not
sealed with signet-rings. Also he records the chiefs
as casting lots about niceting a challenge from the
enemy without using signet· rings α· , and ohe also says
that the god of handicraft in the original period
frequently made brooches and othere aiticles of
