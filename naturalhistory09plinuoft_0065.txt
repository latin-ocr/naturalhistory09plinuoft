Tagus in Spain, the Po in Italy, the Maritza in
Thrace, the Sarabat in Asia Minor and the Ganges in
India3 and there is no gold that is in a more perfect
state, as it is thoroughly polished by the mere friction
of the current. Another methodis by sinking shafts ;
or it is sought for in the fallen debris of mountains.
Each of these methods must be described.

People seeking for gold begin by getting up

estimate of the vein is made. Sometimes by a rare
piece of luck a pocket is found immediately, on the
surface of the earth, as occurred recently in Dalmatia
when Nero was emperor, one yielding fifty pounds
weight of gold a day. Gold found in this way in the
surface crust is called talutium if there is also auri-
ferous earth underneath. The otherwise dry, barren
mountains of the Spanish provinces which produce
nothing else whatever are forced into fertility in
regard to this commodity.

Gold dug up from shafts is called ‘ channelled ’ or
‘ trenched ’ gold; it is found sticking to the grit of
marble, not in the way in which it gleams in the
lapis lazuli of the East and the stone ὓ of Thebes ⁰
and in other precious stones, but sparkling in the folds
of the marble, These channels of veins wander to
and fro along the sides of the shafts, which gives the
gold its name; and the earth is held up by wooden
props. The substance dug out is crushed‚ washed‚
