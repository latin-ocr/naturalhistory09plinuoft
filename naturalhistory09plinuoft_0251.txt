to have cured Telephus, whether he did it by means
of a copper javelin or an iron one3 at all events
Achilles is so represented in painting, knocking the
rust off a javelin with his sword. Rust of iron is
obtained by scraping it off old nails with an iron tool
dipped in water. The effect of rust is to unite
wounds and dry them and staunch them, and applied
as a liniment it relieves fox-mange. They also use
it with wax and oil of myrtle for scabbiness of the
eye—lids and pimples in all parts of the body, but
dipped in vinegar for erysipelas and also for scab,
and, applied on pieces of eloth, for hangnails on the
fingers and whitlows. Applied on wool it arrests
women’s discharges and for recent wounds it is useful
diluted with wine and kneaded with myrrh, and for
swellings round the anus dipped in vinegar. Used
as a liniment it also relieves gout.

wounds are chiefly made ! And it also arrests female
discharges. It is also applied against troubles of the
spleen, and it checks haemorrhoidal swellings and
creeping ulcers. Applied for a brief period in the
form of a powder it is good for the eyelids. But
its chief recommendation is its use in a wet plaster
for cleaning wounds and fistulas and for eating out
every kind of callosity and making new flesh on
bones that have been denuded. The following are
the ingredients: six obols of bee-glue, six drams of
Cimolo earth,‘³ two drams of pounded copper, two of
