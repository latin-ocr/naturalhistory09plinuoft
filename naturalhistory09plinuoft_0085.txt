made of Cyprian copper in mortars of the same
metal, and the Latin name for the mixture is
santerna. It is in this way used in soldering the
gold called silv ery g-o;ld a sign of its having been
so treated is if the application of borax gives it
brilliance. On the other hand ‘coppery' gold
shrinks in size and becomes dull, and is difficult to
solder; for this purpose a solder is made by adding
some gold and one seventh as much silver to the
materials above specified, and grinding thern up
together,

XXX. While speaking of this it will be well to
annex the remaining particulam, so as to occasion
all-round admiration for Nature. The proper solder
for gold is the one described3 for iron, potter’s clay3
for copper in masses, cadmea ας for copper in sheets‚
alum3 for lead and marble‚ resin. Black lead how-
ever is joined by means of white lead? and white
lead to white lead by using oil; stagnum ⁶ likewise
with copper filings, and silver with stagnum. For
smelting copper and iron pine-wood makes the best
fuel, though Egyptian papyrus can also be used;
gold is best smelted with a fire made of chaff. Water
puts heat into quicklime and Thracian stone, ‘² and
olive· oil puts it out; fire however is most readily
quenched by vineg:> r‚ar mistletoe and eggs. Ea1th it
is quite impossible to ignite, but charcoal gives a
more pow erful heat if it is burned till it goes out and
then catches fire again.

XXXI. After these details let us speak about the
varieties of silver ore, the next madness of mankind.
Silver is only found in deep shaftS, and raises no
hopes of its existence by any signs, giving off no
shining sparkles such as are seen in the case of gold,
