off very second best in comparison with the original
artist, having entered into competition in what was
not really his line. Pausias also first introduced the
painting of panelled ceilings, and it was not
customary before him to decorate arched roofs in
this way. He used to paint miniatures, and
especially children. His rivals explained this prac-
tice as being due to the slow pace of his work in
painting; and consequently to give his work also the
reputation of speed he finished a picture in a single
day, a picture of a boy which was called in Greek
Hemeresios‚ meaning One-day Boy. In his youth
he fell in love with a fellow -townswoman named
Gly cera, who invented chaplets of flow ers3 and by
imitating her in rivalry he advanced the art of
encaustic painting so as to reproduce an extremely
numerous variety of flow ers. Finally he painted a
portrait of the woman herself, seated and wearing a
wreath, which is one of the very finest of pictures;
it is called in Greek Stephanoplocos‚ Girl making
VVreaths‚ or by others Stephanopolis‚ Girl selling
VVreaths, because Glycera had supported her poverty
by that trade. A copy (in Greek apographon) of
this picture was bought by Lucius Lucullus at
Athens for two talents3 <it had been made by> 83—713.C.
Dionysius at Athens. But Pausias also did large
pictures, for instance the Sacrifice of Oxen which
formerly was to be seen in Pompey' s Portico
He first invented a method of painting which has
afterwards been copied by many people but equalled
by no one; the chief point was that although he
wanted to show the long body of an ox he painted
the animal facing the spectator and not standing
sideways‚ and its great size is fully conveyed.“
