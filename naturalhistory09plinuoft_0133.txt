From blue is made the substance called blue wash‚
which is produced by washing and grinding it.
Blue wash is of a paler colour than blue‚ and it costs
10 denarii per pound, while blue costs 8 denarii.
Blue is used on a surface of clay, as it will not stand

blue wash of a very inferior kind, called ground blue,
valued at 5 asses.

it is employed as an ingredient in plasters‚ and also
in cauteries, but it is extremely difficult to pound up.
Yellow ochre used as a drug has a gently mordant
and astringent effect, and fills up ulcers. To make

a particular merchant has bought them, or as some
dealer dominating the mai-ket may whip up the
