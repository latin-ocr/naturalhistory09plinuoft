with oil, for fear that water might harden them and
make them brittle. And it is remarkable that when
a vein of ore is fused the iron becomes liquid like
water and afterwards acquires a spongy and brittle
texture. Human blood takes its revenge from iron,
as if iron has come into contact with it, it becomes
the more quickly liable to rust.

XLII. WVe will speak in the appropriate place
about the lode-stone and the sympathy which it has
with iron. Iron is the only substance that catches
the infection of that stone and retains it for a long
period, taking hold of other iron, so that we may
sometimes see a chain of rings3 the ignorant lower
classes call this ‘ live iron,' and wounds inflicted with
it are more severe. This sort of stone forms in
Biscaya also α not in a continuous rocky stratum
like the genuine lodestone alluded to but in a scattered
pebbly formation or ‘ bubbling ’-that is what they
call it. Ι (10 not know whether it is equally useful
for glass founding, as no one has hitherto tested it,
but it certainly imparts the same magnetic property
to iron. The architect Timochares had begun to use
lodestone for constructing the vaulting in the Temple
of Arsinoe b at Alexandria, so that the iron statue
contained in it might have the appearance of being
suspended in mid air ; but the proj ect was interrupted
by his own death and that of King Ptolemy who had
ordered the work to be done in honour of his sister.
XLIII. Iron ore is found in the greatest abundance
of all metals. In the coastal part of Biscaya washed
by the Atlantic there is a very high mountain which,
marvellous to relate, consists entirely of that mineral,
as we stated ⁶ in our account of the lands bordering
on the Ocean.
