BOOK XXXIII. 1v. 8—11

who would not admit this to be more mythical still?
It was the hand and what is more the left ‘² hand,
that first won for gold such high esteem3 not indeed
a Roman hand, whose custom it was to wear an iron
ring as an emblem of warlike valour.

As to the Roman kings I find it hard to make a
statement. The statue of Romulus in the Capitol
has nothing, nor has any other king’s statue excep—
ting those of Numa and Servius Tullius, and not even
that of Lucius Brutus.b I arn especially surprised at
this in the case of the Tarquins, who came originally
from Greece, the country from which this fashion in
rings came, although an iron ring is worn in Sparta
even at the present day. But of all, Tarquinius
Priscus, it is well known, first presented his son with
a golden amulet when while still of an age to wear
the bordered robe ⁰ he had killed an enemy in battle 3
and from that time on the custom of the amulet has
continued as a distinction to be worn by the sons
of those who have served in the cavalry, the sons of
all others only wearing a leather strap. Owing to
this Ι am surprised that the statue of that Tarquin
has no ring. All the same, I notice that there is a
difference of opinion even about the actual word
for a ring. The Greek name d for it is derived from
the word meaning a finger3 with ourselves, in early
days it was called ‘ ungulus,' ⁶³ but afterwards both
our people and the Greeks give it the name of
‘ symbolum.'s For a long period indeed, it is quite

² The word survives in fragments of early poetry.

J Greek σύμβολον, originally meaning two parts of a coin or
other object broken in half to serve as a means of identifica-
tion because tallying when put together3 and so the word
was used to denote any token or symbol.
