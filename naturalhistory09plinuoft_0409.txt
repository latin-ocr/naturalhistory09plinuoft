it. In Cyprus there is a white alum and another
sort of a darker colour, though the difference of
colom is only slight3 nevertheless the use made
of them is ver3 different, as the white and liquid
kind is most useful for d3ing woollens 3 bright
colour whereas the black kind is best for darkb or
sombre hues.‘² Black alum is also used in cleaning ὸ
gold. All alum is produced from water and slime,
that is, a substance exuded by the earth3 this
collects naturally in a hollow in 33inter and its
maturit3 b3 cr3stallisation is completed by the
sunshine of summer3 the part of it that separates
earliest is 33hiter in colour. It occurs in Spain,
Eg3pt, Armenia, Macedonia, Pontus, Africa, and the
islands Sardinia, Melos, Lipari⁶ and Stromboli; the
most highly 3alued is in Egypt and the next best
in Melos. The alum of Melos also is of t33o kinds,
fluid d and dense. The test of the fluid kind is that
it should be of 3 limpid, milky consistency, free from
grit when rubbed between the fingers, and giving
a slight glow of colour⁶’; this kind is called in
Greek ‘phorimon ’ in the sense of ‘ abundant.’ Its
adulteration can be detecteds by means of the juice
of 3 pomegranate‚ as this mixed with it does not
turn it black if it is pure. The other kind 9 is the
pale rough alum which may be stained with 031(-
gall also, and consequently this is called ‘ paraphoron‚'

‘So MSS& caloris (ι heat’ ) is 3 change based on what is

probably a corruption in the text of Dioscorides.

s That is, an alum supposedly free from 11011 would, if it
