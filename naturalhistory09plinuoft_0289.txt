his late lamented Majesty Augustus also approved
of the plan. The child made great progress in the
art, but died before he grew up. But painting
chiefly derived its rise to esteem at Rome, in my
judgement, from Manius Valerius Maximus Messala.
who in the year 490 after the foundation of the 264 ao.
city first showed a picture in public on a side wall
of the Curia Hostilia: the subject being the battle
in Sicily in which he had defeated the Carthaginians
and Hiero. The same thing was also done by
Lucius Scipio, who put up in the Capitol a picture of
his Asiatic victorya: this is said to have annoyed
his brother Africanus, not without reason, as his son
had been taken prisoner in that battle. Also Lucius
Hostilius Mancinusb who had been the first to
force an entrance into Carthage incurred a very
similar offence with Aemilianus by displaying in the
forum a picture of the plan of the city and of the
attacks upon it and by himself standing by it and
describing to the public looking on the details of the
siege, a piece of popularity—hunting which won him
the consulship at the next election. Also the stage
erected for the shows given by Claudius Pulcher 99 ao,
won great admiration for its painting, as crows were
seen trying to alight on the roof tiles represented
on the scenery, quite taken in by its realism.
