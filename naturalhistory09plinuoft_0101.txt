of cinnabar is extremely useful for antidotes and

medicaments. But our doctors, Ι swear, because

they give the name of cinnabar to minium also, employ

from Ephesus was also used for painting, but this

has been given up because pictures in that colour

in selling it being fixed by law established at 70

sesterces a pound, to prevent its going beyond limit.

But it is adulterated in many ways, which is a source [ζεᾱ lead and

of plunder for the company. For there is in fact amabar,
