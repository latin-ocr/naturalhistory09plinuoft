fought under a most solemn oath3 the metal was
obtained from their breastplates, greaves and
helmets. and the size of the figure is so great that it
can be seen from the temple of Jupiter Latiaris.⁶‘
Out of the bronze filings left over Carvilius made

in our period by Zenodorus with the Hermes or
Mercury which he made in the community of the
Arverni in Gaul3 it took him ten years and the sum

given sufficient proof of his artistic skill in Gaul he was
summoned to Rome by Nero, and there made the
colossal statue, 106} ft. high, intended to represent
that emperor but now, dedicated to the sun after
the condemnation of that emperor-’s crimes, it is an
object of awe. In his studio we used not only to
