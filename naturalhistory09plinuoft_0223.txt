prefer to grind copper filings mixed with vinegar
in copper morsm-s. But the quickest result is
obtained by adding to the vinegar shavings of
coronet copper. Rhodian verdigris is adulterated
chiefly with pounded marble, though others use
pumicestone or gum. But the adulteration of
verdigris that is the most difficult to detect is done
with shoemakers’ black,a the other adulterations
being detected by the teeth as they crackle when
chewed. Verdigris can be tested on a hot fire-
shoveL as a specimen that is pure keeps ὸ its colour,
but what is mixed with shoemakers' black turns red.
It is also detected by means of papyrus previously
steeped in an infusion of plantgall, as this when
smeared with genuine verdigris at once turns black.
It can also be detected by the eye, as it has an evil
green colour. But whether pure or adulterated‚ the
best way is to wash it and when it is dry to burn it
on a new pan and keep turning it over till it becomes
glowing ashes; and afterwards it is crushed and
put away in store. Some people burn it in raw
earthenware vessels till the earthenware is baked
through3 some mix in also some male frankincense.
Ver-digris is washed in the same way as cadmea. §loa
Its powerfulness is very well suited for eye-salves
and its mordant action makes it able to produce
watering at the eyes; but it is essentia] to wash it
off with swabs ⁰ and hot water till its bite ceases to be
felt.

XXVII. Hierax's Salve is the name given to an
eye-salve chiefly composed of verdigris. It is made
by mixing together four ounces of gum of Hamm0n‚d

variety of common salt, which itself is not sal ammoniae =
ammonium chloride).
