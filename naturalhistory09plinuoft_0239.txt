ought to be strewn with charcoal-dust.

diphryx‚ from its being twice roasted. It comes
from three different sources. It is said to be ob-
tained from a mineral pyrites which is heated in
furnaces till it is smelted into a red earth. It is also
made in Cyprus from mud obtained from a certain
cavei-n, which is first dried and then gradually has
burning brushwood put round it. A third way of
producing it is from the residue that falls to the
bottom in copper furnaces; the difference is that
the copper itself runs down into crucibles and the
slag forms outside the furnace and the flower floats on
the top, but the supplies of diphryx remain behind.
Some people say that certain globules of stone that
is being smelted in the furnaces become soldered
together and round this the copper gets red hot,
but the stone itselfis not fused unless it is transferred
into other furnaces, and that it is a sort of kernel
of the substance5 and that what is called diphryx
is the residue left from the smelting. Its use in
medicine is similar to that of the substances already
described 3 to dry up moisture and remove excrescent
growths and act as a detergent. It can be tested
by the tongue—contact with it ought immediately
to have a parching effect and impart a flavour of
copper.

XXXVIII. We will not omit one further remark-
able thing about copper. The Servilian family,
famous in our annals, possesses a bronze ὲ as piece
which it feeds with gold and silver and which con-
sumes them both. Its origin and nature are un-
