‘ perverted ’ or adulterated alum. Liquid alum α
has an astringent, hardening and corrosive property.
Mixed with honey it cures ulcers in the mouth,
pimples and eruptions3 this treatment is carried
out in baths containing two parts of honey to one
of alum. It reduces odour from the armpits and
perspiration. It is taken in pills against disordcrs
of the spleen and discharge of blood in the urine.
Mixed with soda and chamomile it is also a remedy
for scabies.

One kind ¹² of solid alum which is called in Greek
schiston, ‘ splittable‚’ splits into a sort of filament of a
whitish colour‚ owing to which some people have pre-
ferred to give it in Greek the name of trichitis, ‘ hairy
alum.' This is produced from the same ore as
copper, known as copperstone, a sort of sweat from
that mineral, coagulated into foam. This kind of
alum has less drying effect and serves less to arrest
the detrimenta] humours of the body, but it is
extremely beneficia] as an ear-wash‚ or as a liniment
also for ulcers of the mouth and for the teeth, and if
it is retained in the mouth with saliva3 or it forms a
suitable ingredient in medicines for the eyes and
for the genita] organs of either sex. It is roasted in
crucibles until it has quite lost its liquidity.⁶ There
is another alum of a less active kind, c illed 1n Greek
strongyle, ‘round alum. ' Of this also there are two
varieties, the sung-ous Which dissolv es easily in any
liquid and uhich is rejected as entirely vworthless,
and a better kind which is porous and pierced with
small holes like a sponge and of a round formation,
nearer white in colom, possessing a certain quality
of unctuousness, free from grit, friable, and not apt
to cause a black stain. This is roasted by itself on
