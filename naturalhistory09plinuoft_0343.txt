Magabyzus, the priest of Artemis of Ephesus, a
Clitus with Horse hastening into battle3 and an

face of Alexander from both works and substitute
portraits of Augustus. The Heracles with Face
Averted in the temple of Diana is also believed to be
by his hand—So drawn that the picture more truly

began to neigh when they saw the horse painted by
Apelles; and this always happened subsequently,
showing it to be a sound test of artistic skill. He
