taken up by the whole of the world, and the custom
proceeded to arise of having statues adorning the
public places of all municipal towns and of per-
petuating the memory of human beings and of
inscribing lists of honours on the bases to be read
for all time, so that such records should not be
read on their tombs only. Soon after a publicity
centre was established even in private houses
and in our own halls: the respect felt by clients
inaugurated this method of doing honour to their
atrons.
p X. In old days the statues dedicated were simply
clad in the toga. Also naked figures holding spears,
made from models of Greek young men from the
gymnasiums—what are called figures of Achilles—
became popular. The Greek practice is to leave the
, figure entirely nude, whereas Roman and military
statuary adds a breastplate: indeed the dictator
Caesar gave permission for a statue wearing a cuirass
to be erected in his honour in his Forum.⁰ As for
the statues in the garb of the Luperci, they are
modern innovations‚ just as much as the portrait-
statues dressed in cloaks that have recently appeared.
Mancinus ὓ set up a statue of himself in the dress
that he had worn when surrendered to the
enemy. It has been remarked by writers that the
poet Lucius Accius also set up a very tall statue of
himself in the shrine of the Latin Muses, although
he was a very short man. Assuredly equestrian
statues are popular at Rome, the fashion for them
having no doubt been derived from Greece; but
the Greeks used only to erect statues of winners
of races on horse-back at their sacred contests,
although subsequently they also erected statues of

Greek and

styles.
