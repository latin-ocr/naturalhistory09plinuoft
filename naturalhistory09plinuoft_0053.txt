BOOK XXXIII. xiv. 48-XV. 51

hunger for gold flared up with a sort of frenzy,
inasmuch as the friend of Gaius Gracchus, Sep-
tumuleius, a price having been set on Gracchus’s 121 BS-
head to the amount of its weight in gold, when
Gracchus’s head had been cut off, brought it to
Opimius,a after adding to his unnatural murder by
putting lead in the mouth of the corpse, and so
cheated the state in addition. Nor was it now some
Roman citizen, but King Mithridates who dis-
graced the whole name of Roman when he poured
molten gold into the mouth of the Genera] Aquilius
whom he had taken prisoner.b These are the
things that the lust for possessions engenders! One
is ashamed to see the new-fangled names that are
invented every now and then from the Greek to
denote silvei· vessels filigreed or inlaid with gold,
niceties which make gilded plate fetch a higher
price than gold plate‚ when we know that Spartacus ⁶
issued an order to his camp forbidding anybody to
possess gold or silver: so much more spirit was there
then in our run-away slaves! The orator Messala
has told us that the triumvir Antony used vessels of c. 83-30 Bc.
gold in satisfying all the indecent necessities, an
enormity that even Cleopatra would have been 69-8-30 wo.
ashamed of. Till then the record in extravagance
had lain with foreigners-King Philip sleeping with gssg‘sfd 359-
a gold goblet under his pillows and Alexander the ἴέῖἶῖεῗίἓὲιμ
Great's prefect Hagnon of Teos having his sandals ³⁴23 ¹³0·
soled with gold nails; but Antony alone cheapened
gold by this contumely of nature. How he deserved
to be proscribed! but proscribed by Spartacus l ‘²

nation always imposed a tribute of silver, not of gold, {Jefflffl gam

on races that it conquered, for instance on Carthage fflifzissm
