and the Sicyonian Telephanes—these were at that
stage not using any colour, yet already adding

lines here and there to the interior of the outlines;
hence it became their custom to write on the pictures

the names of the persons represented. Ecphantus

of Corinth is said to have been the first to daub these
drawings with a pigment made of powdered earthen-

collapse of the temple. The Emperor Caligula from Aa). 37.
lustful motives attempted to remove them, but the
consistency of the plaster would not allow this to be
done. There are pictures surviving at Caere that
are even older. And whoever carefully judges
these works will admit that none of the arts reached
full perfectiori more quickly, inasmuch as it is
clear that painting did not exist in the Trojan
period.
