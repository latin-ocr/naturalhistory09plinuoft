quantities and burnt, it produces sandyx or ver-
milion——though it is true that I observe V irgil held
the view that sandyx is a plant, from the line:

Sandlyx sels-grown shall clothe the pasturing

colours weigh heavier than these.

XXIV. Among the artificia] colours is also Syrian
colour, which as we said is used as an undercoating
for cinnabar and red lead. It is made by mixing
sinopis and sandyx together.

XXV. Black pigment will also be classed among
the artificial colours, although itc is also derived
from earth in two ways; it either exudes from the

plans are troublesome and new-fangled; for black

produced by burning resin or pitch, owing to which
