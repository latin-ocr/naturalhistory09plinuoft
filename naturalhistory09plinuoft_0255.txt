other substance mixed with it, or it forms together
with silver, and is smelted with the two veins mixed
togethe1·.‘² Of this substance the liquid that melts
first in the furnaces is called stagnum ¹²3 the second
liquid is argentiferous lead, and the residue left in
the furnaces is impure lead ⁰ which forms a third
part of the vein originally put in; when this is
again fused it gives black lead, having lost two-
ninths in bulk.

stagnum the contents have a more agreeable taste
and the formation of destructive verdigris is pre-
vented‚ and, what is remarkable, the w eight is not
increased. Also, as we have sud, it used to be XXXIH
employed at Biindisi as a material for making-¹3⁰·
mirrors which were very celebrated, until even

and one of white3 its price is 20 denarii a pound.
It is used for soldering pipes. More dishonest
makers add to tertiary an equal amount of white
lead and call it ‘ silver mixture‚' and use it melted
for plating by immersion any articles they wish.
They put the price of this last at 70 denarii for 1 lb. ς
the price of pure white lead without alloy is 80 denarii,
and of black lead 7 denarii.
