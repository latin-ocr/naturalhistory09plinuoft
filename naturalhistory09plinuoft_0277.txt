be known even when alive ⁰! That is exactly how
things are: indolence has destroyed the arts, and
since our minds cannot be portmyed, our bodily
features are also neglected. In the halls of our
ancestors it was otherwise ; portraits were the obj ects
displayed to be looked at, not statues by foreign
artists, nor bronzes nor marbles‚ but wax models of
faces were set out each on a separate side-board‚ to
furnish likenesses to be carried in procession at a
funeral in the elan, and always when some member
of it passed away the entire company of his house
that had ever existed was present. The pedigrees
too were traced in a spread of lines running near the
several painted portraits. The archive—rooms ὸ were
kept filled with books of records and with written
memorials of official careers. Outside the houses and
round the doorways there were other presentations of
those mighty spirits, with spoils taken from the
enemy fastened to them, which even one who bought
the house was not permitted to unfasten‚ and the
mansions eternally celebrated a triumph even though
they changed their masters. This acted as a mighty
incentive, when every day the very walls reproached
an unwarlike owner with intruding on the triumphs
of another! There is extant an indignant speech by
the pleader Messala protesting against the insertion
among the likenesses of his family of a bust not
belonging to them but to the family of the Laevini.⁶
A similar reason extracted from old Messala the
volumes he composed ‘ On Families‚’ because when
passing through the hall of Scipio Pomponianus he
had observed the Salvittones d—that was their
