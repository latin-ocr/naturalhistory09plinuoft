is to plate bronze articles with white lead so as to make
them almost indistinguishable from silver3 articles
thus treated are called ‘ incoctilia.' Later they also
proceeded in the town Alesia b to plate with silver in
a similar manner, particularly ornaments f01 horses
and pack animals and yokes of oxen3 the distinction

Then they proceeded to decorate two-wheeled war-

on papyrus to seem to have burst the paper by its
weight and not by its heat. India possesses neither
copper nor lead, and procures thern in exchange for
her precious stones and pearls

and sheets is excavated with considerable labour
in Spain and through the whole of the Gallie
provinces, but in Britain it is found in the surface-
stratum of the earth in such abundance that there
is a law prohibiting the production of more than a
certain amount. The various kinds· of black lead
