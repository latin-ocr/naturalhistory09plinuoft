two of Cyprian verdig1·iS‚ two of the copperas called
flower of copper, one of misy ‘¹ and six of saffr0n; all
these ingredients are pounded in Thasian vinegar
and made up into pills, that are an outstanding
specifie against incipient glaucoma and cataract‚
and also against films on the eyes or roughnesses
and white ulcerations in the eye and affections of
the eyelids. Verdigris in a crude state is used as an
ingredient in plasters for wounds also. In combina-
tion with oil it is a marvellous cure for ulcerations of
the mouth and gums and for sore lips, and if wax
is also added to the mixture it cleanses them and
makes them form a cicatrix. Verdigris also eats away
the callosity of fistulas and of sores round the anus,
either applied by itself or with gum of Hammon‚b or
inserted into the fistula in the manner of a salve.
Verdigris kneaded up with a third part of turpentine
also removes leprosy.

XXVIII. There is also another kind of verdigris
called from the Greek worm-like verdigris, made by
grinding up in a mortar of true cyprian copper with a
pestle of the same meta] equal weights of alum and
salt or soda with the very strongest white vinegar.
This preparation is only made on the very hottest days
of the year, about the rising of the Dogstar. The
mixture is ground up until it becomes of a green
colour and shrivels into what looks like a cluster of
small worms, whence its name. To remedy any
that is blemished, the urine of a young boy to twice
the quantity of vinegar that was used' is added to the
mixturefi [sed as a drug, w orm· -verdigris has the
same effect as santeina which xx e spoke of as used for
soldering gold3 both of them have the same
properties as verdigris. Native worm-verdigris is
