XIX. Melinuma also is a white colour‚ the best
occurring in the island of Melos. It is found in
Samos also, but the Samian is not used by painters,
because it is excessively greasy. It is dug up in
Samos by people lying on the ground and searching

effect. It costs 3 sesterce a pound.

The third of the white pigments is ceruse or lead
acetate, the nature of which we have stated in
speaking of the ores of lead. There was also once 3
native ceruse earthb found on the estate of Theodotus
