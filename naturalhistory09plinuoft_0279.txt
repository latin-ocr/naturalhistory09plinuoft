BOOK XXXV. 11. 8-11

former surname—in consequence osan act of adop-
tion by will creeping into others' preserves, to the
discredit of the Scipios called AfricanuS.⁰ But the
Messala family must excuse me ifI say that even to
lay a false claim to the portraits of famous men
showed some love for their virtues, and was much
more honourable than to entail by one's conduct that
nobody should seek to obtain one's own portraits!

We must not pass over a novelty that has also been Porcrait-
invented, in that likenesses made, if not of gold or ῗξὲζὲᾒεξη
silver‚ yet at all events of bronze are set up in the
libraries in honour of those whose immortal spirits
speak to us in the same places, nay more, even
imaginary likenesses are modelled and sense of loss
gives birth to countenances that have not been
handed down to us, as occurs in the case of Homer.

At any rate in my view at all events there is
no greater kind of happiness than that all people
for all time should desire to know what kind of a man
a person was. At Rome this practice originated
with Asinius Pollio, who first by founding a library After 39 Β.ο.
made works of genius the property of the public.
VVhether this practice began earlier, with the Kings
of Alexandria and of Pe1·gamum‚‘’ between whom
there had been such a keen competition in founding
libraries, I cannot readily say. The existence of a
strong passion for portraits in former days is
evidenced by Atticus the friend of Cicero in the
volume he published on the subject and by the most
benevolent invention of Marcus Varro, who actually

by some means inserted in a prolific output of

ὸ Ptolemy I of Egypt (died 283 B.c.) and Attalus I of
Pergamum (241-197 B.c.) both founded libraries, Two at
Alexandria became famous under Ptolemies II and III.
