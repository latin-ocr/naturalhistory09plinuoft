when conquered together with Hannibal, 800‚000 202 ss.C.
pounds weight of silver in yearly instalments of
16,ΟΟΟ pounds spread over 50 years, but no gold. Nor
can it be considered that this was due to the world's
poverty. Midas and Croesus had already possessed
wealth without limit, and Cyrus had already on con-
quering Asia Minor found booty consisting of 24,000 516-2-'2 mr.
pounds weight of gold, besides vessels and articles
made of gold, including a throne, a plane-tree and a
vine. And by this victory he carried off 500,()ΟΟα
talents of silver and the wine-bowl of Semiramis the
weight of which came to 15 talents. The Aegyptiam
talent according to Marcus Varro amounts to ΕΟ
pounds of gold. Saulaces the descendant of Aeetes
had already reigned in Colchis, who is said to have
come on a tract of virgin soil in the country of the
Suani and elsewhere and to have dug up from it a great
quantity of gold and silver, his realm being moreover
famous for golden fleeces.b We are also told of his
gold-vaulted ceilings and silver beams and columns
and pilasterS, belonging to Sesostris King of Egypt
whom Saulaces conquered, so proud a monarch that
he is reported to have been in the habit every year
of harnessing to his chariot individua] kings selected
by lot from among his vassals and so going in
triumphal procession.

XVI. We too have done things to be deemed
mythical by those who come after us. Caesar, the
future dictator, was the first person in the office of
aedile to use nothing but silver for the appointments 65 m.
of the arena—it was at the funeral games presented
in honour of his father3 and this was the first

daughter of King Aeetes. The fleece was later carried away
by J ason and the Argcmauts.
