BOOK XXXV. XL. 130—132

Contemporaries of Euphranor were Cydias, for
whose picture of the Argonauts the orator Hortensius
paid l44‚000 sesterces, and made 3 shrine for its
reception at his m‘lla at Tusculum. Euphranor's
pupil was Antidotus. WVorks by the latter are a
Combatant with a Shield at Athens and 3 VVrestler
and a Trumpeter which has been exceptionally
praised. Antidotus himself was more careful in his
work than prolific, and severe in his use of colours3
his chief distinction was being the teacher of the

Athenian Nicias, who was an extremely carefulff

painter of female portraits. Nicias kept a strict
watch on light and shade, and took the greatest pains
to make his paintings stand out from the panels.
Works of his are: a Nemea, brought to Rome from
Asia by Silanus and deposited in the Senate—house as

we have said, and also the Father Liber or Dionysus z

in the Shrine of Concord, 3 Hyacinthus with which
Caesar Augustus was so delighted that when he took
Alexandria he brought it back with him—and
consequently Tiberius Caesar dedicated this picture
in the Temple α of Augustus—and 3 Ι)3η3ἓ; while at
Ephesus there is the tomb of a megabyzus or priest
of Diana of Ephesus, and at Athens there is a
Necyomantea b of Homer. The last the artist
refused to sell to King Attalus ⁶ for 60 talents, and
preferred to present it to his native place, as he
was 3 wealthy man. He also executed some large
pictures, among them 3 Calypso, an Iod and an
Andromeda, and also the very fine Alexander in
Pompey's Porticoes and a Seated Calypso are as-
signed to him.
