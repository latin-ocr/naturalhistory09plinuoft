the eyes, pain and mistiness in the eyes, and ulcera·

with henbane seed it draws out splinters of broken

plasters used for relieving pains. The whitish part
of it is preferred to the violet kinds for one purpose,

relieve ear-trouble. Applied by itself as a liniment
it heals wounds, but it leaves a discoloration in the
sears. There has lately been discovered a plan of
sprinkling it on the mouths of bears and lions in the
arena, and its astringent action is so powerful that
they are unable to bite.
