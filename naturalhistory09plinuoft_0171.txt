it to shelter it on the side where it was most necessary
to break the force of the wind. Accordingly,
because of its size, and the difficulty of moving it
with great labour, Fabius Verrucosus left it alone
when he transferred the Heracles from that place
to the Capitol where it now stands. But calling for
admiration before all others was the colossal Statue
of the Sun at Rhodes made by Chares of Lindus,
the pupil of Lysippus mentioned above. This
statue was 105 ft. high3 and, 66 years after its

erection, was overthrown by an earthquake‚ but c.2

people can make their arms meet round the thumb
of the figure, and the fingers are larger than most

statues3 and where the limbs have been broken off

masses of rock nith the w eight of which the artist
steadied it when he erected it. It is recorded that
it took tw elv e 3 ears to complete and cost 300 talents‚

which though smaller than this one would have each

have stood alone3 and besides these there were
five colossal statues of gods, made by Bryaxis.

Italy also was fond of making colossal statues.

At all events we see the Tuscanicb Apollo in the S

library of the Temple of Augustus, 50 ft. in height
measuring from the toe ; and it is a question whether
it is more remarkable for the quality of the bronze
or for the beauty of the work. Spurius Carvilius
also made the Jupiter that stands in the Capitol,
