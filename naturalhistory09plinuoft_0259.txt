have the following names—Oviedo lead, Capraria
lead, Oleastrum lead, though there is no difference
between thern provided the slag has been carefully
smelted away. It is a remarkable fact in the case
of these mines only that when they have been
abandoned they replenish themselves and become
more productive. This seems to be due to the air
infusing itself to saturation through the open
orifices‚ just as a miscarriage seems to make some
women more prolific. This was recently observed
in the Salutariensian mine in Baetica, which used to
be let at a rent of 200‚000 denarii a year, but which
was then abandoned, and subsequently let for
255‚000. Likewise the Antonian mine in the same
province from the same rent has reached a return
of 400‚OOO sesterces. It is also remarkable that
vessels made of lead will not melt if they have water
put in thern, but if to the water a pebble or quarter-
as coin is added, the fire burns through α the vessel.
L. In medicine lead is used by itself to remove Meidcat
scars, and leaden plates are applied to the region Ξάάθ]
of the loins and kidneys for their comparative chilly
nature to check the attacks of veneieal passions,
and the libidinous dreams that cause spontaneous
emissions to the extent of constituting a kind of
disease. It is recorded that the pleader Calvus
used these plates to control himself and to preserve
his bodily strength for laborious study. Nero,
whom heaven w as &pleased to make emperor used to
have a plate of lead on his chest when singing song s
fortissimo, thus showing a method for preserving the
voice. Ior medical purposes lead is melted in
earthen vesseIS, a lay er of finely powdered sulphur
being put underneath it; on this thin plates are
