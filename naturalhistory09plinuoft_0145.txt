then those which your connoisseurs sometimes
convert into dishes for food and sometimes into
lamps or even washing basins, without nice regard
for deceney.⁰ There are three kinds of this sort of
bronze: a white variety, coming very near to silver
in brilliance, in which the alloy ofsilver predominatcs ;
a second kind, in which the yellow quality of gold
predominates, and a third kind in which all the metals
were blended in equa] proportions. Besides these
there is another mixture the formula for which
cannot be given, although it is man's handiwork3
but the bronze valued in portrait statues and others
for its peculiar colour, approaching the appearance
of liver and consequently called by a Greek name
‘ hepatizon ' meaning ‘ liverish,' is a blend produced
by luck3 it is far behind the Corinthjan blend, yet

of Delos which long held the first rank.

IV. The Delian bronze was the earliest to become
famous, the whole world thronging the markets
in Delos; and hence the attention paid to the
processes of making it. It was at Delos that bronze
first came into prominence as a material used for
the feet and framework of dining-couches, and later
it came to be employed also for images of the gods
and statues of men and other living things.

V. The next most famous bronze was the
Aeginetan3 and the island of Aegina itself became
celebrated for it, though not because the metal
copper was mined there but because of the com-
pounding done in the workshops. A bronze ox
looted from Aegina stands in the cattle-market at
Rome, and will serve as a specimen of Aegina bronze,
