another kind a of minium, found in almost all silver-
mines, and likewise lead-mines, which is made by
smelting a stone that has veins of metal running
through it, and not obtained from the stone the
round drops of which we have designated qujck-§os
silver—-for that stone also if fired yields quicksilver—
but from other stones found at the same time.
These have no quicksilver and are detected only
by their leaden colour, and only when they turn red
in the furnaces, and after being thoroughly smelted
they are pulverized by hammering. This gives a
minium of second rate quality, which is known to
very few people, and is much inferior to the natural
sands we have mentioned. It is this then that is
used for adulterating real minium in the factories of
the company, but a cheaper kind is adulterated with
Syrian: the preparation of the latter will be des· XXXV. 411.
cribed in the proper place3 but the process of giving
cinnabar and red-lead a treatment of Syrian is
detected by calculation when the one is weighed
against the other. Cinnabar also, with red-lead,
affords an opportunity for pilfering by painters in
another way, if they wash out their brushes imme-
diately when full of paint3 the cinnabar or the
red-lead settles at the bottom of the water and stays
there for the pilferers. Pure cinnabar ought to
have the brilliant colour of the scarlet kermes-
insect, while the shine of that of the second quality
when used on wall—paintings is affected by rust,
although this is itself a sort of metallic rust. In
the cinnabar mines b of Almaden the vein of sand
is pure, without silver. It is melted like gold ο; it,
is assayed by means of gold made red hot, as if it
has been adulterated it turns black, but if genuine
