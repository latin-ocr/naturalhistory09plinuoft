BOOK XXXV. tvm. 199—201

Publilius of Antioch⁰ the founder of our mimic
stage and his cousin Manilius ὓ Antiochus the
originator of our astronomy, and likewise Staberius
Eros ⁶ our first grammarian, all of whom our ancestors
saw brought over in the same ship. But why need
anybody mention these men, recommended to
notice as they are by their literary honours? Other
instances α that have been seen on the stand in the
slave market are Chrysogonus freedman of Sulla.
Amphion freedman of Quintus Catulus, Hector
freedman of Lucius LuculluS‚ Demetrius Β freedman
of Pompey, and Auge freedwoman of DemetriuS,
although she herself also was believed to have
belonged to Pompey3 Hipparchus freedman of
Mark Antony, Menas' and Menecrates freedmen
of Sextus Pompeius, and a list of others whom this
is not the occasion to enumerate, who ⁹ have enriched
themselves by the bloodshed of Roman citizens and
by the licence of the proscriptions.h Such is the
mark set on these herds of slaves for sale, and the
disgrace attached to us by capricious fortune 2-
persons whom even we have seen risen to such power
that we actually beheld the honour of the praetor-
ship awarded to them by decree of the Senate at the
bidding of Claudius Caesar's wife Agrippina,i and all
but sent back with the rods of office wreathed in
laurels to the places from which they came to Rome
with their feet whitened with white earth 1 ἱ

f Admiral of Sextus Pompeius c. 40 B.c. He deserted
twice to Octavian. Hipparchus likewise deserted to Octavian.
Menecrates killed himself after ill success under Menas against
Octavian's fleet‚ 38 13.c.

⁹ Especially Chrysogonus and perhaps Hipparchus.

'⁸ By Sulla in 82 and by Antony, Octavian, Lepidus in 43 B.c.
