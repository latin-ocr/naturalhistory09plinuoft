would make thinner earthenware. The pottery
of Cos is most famous for this, but that of Adria is
most substantial, · while there are also some instances
of severity also in relation to pottery. We find
that Quintus Coponius was found guilty of bribery
because he made a present of a jar of wine to a
person who had the right to a vote. Anda so that
luxury also may contribute some importance to
earthenware, the name of 3 service of three dishes,
we are told by Fenestella, used to denote the most
luxurious possible banquet. · one dish was of lamprey,
3 second of pike and 3 third of 3 mixture of fish.
Clearly manners were already on the decline though
nevertheless we can still prefer them ev en to those
of the philosophers of Greece, inasmuch as it is
recorded that at the auction held by the heirs of 322 13,0.
Aristotle seventy earthenware dishes were sold.
We have already stated when on the subject of birds X. 141.
that a single dish cost the tragic actor Aesop 100,000
sesterces, and I have no doubt that readers felt
indignant3 but, good heavens, Vitellius when
emperor had a dish made that eost 1 ,OOQOOO sesterces, M), 69
and to make which a special furnace was constructed
out in open country, 35 luxury has reached a point
when even earthenware costs more than vessels
of fluor-spat. It was owing to this dish that
Mucianus in his second consulship, in a protest ΑΒ· 70-
which he delivered, reproached ‘the memory of
Vitellius for dishes as broad as marshes, although
this particular dish was not more disgraceful than
the poisoned one by which Cassius Severus when
prosecuting Asprenas charged him with having caused
the death of 130 guests. Artistic pottery also con-
fers fame on towns, for instance Reggio and Cumae.
