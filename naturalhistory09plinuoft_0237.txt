are picked out by the fingers. WVhen it is washed
with wine it is particularly powerful. There is also
some difference in the kind of wine used, as when it
is washed with weak wine it is thought to be less
serviceable for eye-salves, and at the same time more
efficacious for running ulcers or for ulcers of the
mouth that are always wet and more useful for all the
antidotes for gangrene. An ash called Lauriotisa
is also produced in furnaces in which silvei· is smelted 3
but the kind said to be most serviceable for the eyes
is that which is formed in smelting gold. Nor is there
any other department in which the ingenuities of life
are more to be admired, inasmuch as to avoid the
need of searching for metals experience has devised
the same utilities by means of the commonest things.

XXXV. The substance called in Greek ‘ anti-
spodos ' ‘ substitute ash ' is the ash of the leaves of the
figtree or wild fig or myrtle together with the tender-
est parts of the branches‚ or of the xxild olive or cul-
tivated olive or quince or mastic and also ash obtained
from unripe, that is still pale, mulberries, dried in the
sun, or from the foliage of the box or mock-gladiolus‚
οι· bramble or turpentine-tree or oenanthe. The
same virtues have also been found in the ash of
bull-glue or of linen fabrics. All of these are burnt
in a pot of raw earth heated in a furnace until the
earthenware is thoroughly baked.

forges by adding additional charcoal when the
copper has already been melted, and thorou ghly
fused, and gradually kindling it3 and suddenly
when a stronger blast is applied a sort of chaff of

some copper (K. C. Bailey).
