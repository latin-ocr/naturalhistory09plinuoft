which is most esteemed for utensils. There are
several ways of preparing it. At Capua it is smelted
in a fire of wood, not of charcoal, and then poured
into cold water and cleaned in a sieve made of Oak,
and this process of smelting is repeated several
times, at the last stage Spanish silver lead α being
added to it in the proportion of ten pounds to one
hundred pounds of copper: this treatment renders it
’ pliable and gn es it an agreeable coloui of a kind
imparted to other sorts of copper and bionze by
means of oil and salt. Bronze resembling the
Campanian is ploduced in many parts of Italy and
the provinces, but there they add only eight pounds
of lead, and do additional smelting with charcoal ὸ
because of their shortage of wood. The difference
produced by this is noticed specially in Gaul, where
the meta] is smelted between stones heated red hot,
as this roasting scorches it and renders it black and
friable. Moreover they only smelt it again once
whereas to repeat this several times contributes a
great deal to the quality. It is also not out of place
to notice that all copper and bronze fuses better in
very cold weather.

peculiar seasoned quality of brilliance that has been
subdued by friction and so to speak tamed by habi-
tual use. Silver- lead is also mixed with it in the
proportion of tuelxe and a half pounds to every
