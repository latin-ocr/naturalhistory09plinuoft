BOOK XXXV. xxxvn. 112-114

Among these was Piraeicus, to be ranked below few
painters in skill 3 it is possible that he won distinction
by his choice of subjects, inasmuch as although
adopting a humble line he attained in that field
the height of glory. He painted barbers’ shops and
cobblers' stalls, asses, viands and the like, conse-
quently receiving a Greek name meaning ‘painter
of sordid subjects'3 in these however he gives
exquisite pleasure, and indeed they fetched bigger
prices than the largest works of many masters. On
the other hand ‘ a picture by Serapio,' says Varro,
‘ covered the whole of the Maeniam Balconies α at
the place Beneath the Old Shops.' Serapio was a
most successful scene-painter, but he could not
paint a human being. On the contrary, Dionysius
painted nothing else but people, and consequently
has a Greek name meaning ‘Painter of Human
Beings.' Callicles also made small pictures, and so
did Calates of subjects taken from comedy3 both
classes ὸ were painted by Antiphilus, who executed
the famous picture of Hesione and an Alexander
and a Philip ⁰ with Athene which are now in the
school in Octavia's Porticoes, and in Philippus'd
Portico a Father Liber or Dionysus, a Young
Alexander, a Hippolytus alarmed by the Bull
rushing upon him, and in Pompey’s Portico a Cadmus
and Europa. He also painted a figure in an absurd
costume known by the joking name of Gryllus, the
name consequently applied to every picture of that
sort. He was himself born in Egypt and a pupil of
Ctesidemus.
