Corinth. He did this owing to his daughter, who
was in lov e with a young man3 and she, when he was
going abroad,d1ew in outline on the wall the shadow
of his face thrown by a lamp Her father pressed
clay on this and made a relies, which he hardened by
exposure to fire with the rest of his pottery3 and it
is said that this likeness was preserved in the Shrine
of the Nymphs until the destruction of Corinth by
Mummius. Some authorities state that the plastic
art was first invented by Rhoecus and T heodorusss
at Sarnos, long before the expulsion of the Bacchiadae
from Corinth, but that when Damaratus, who in
Etruria became the father of Tarquin king of the
Roman people, was banished from the same city,
he was accompanied by the modellers Euchir‚
Diopus and Eugrammus, b and they int. ‘’oduced

to the material οι else modelling out of red chalk,
was an invention of Butades, and he first placed
masks as fronts to the outer gutter-tiles on roofs3
these at the first stage he called prostypa,⁶ but
afterwards he likewise made ectypas] It was from
these that the ornaments on the pediments oftemples
originated. Because of Butades modellers get
their Greek name of plastae.

in plaster of a human being from the living face
itself, and established the method of pouring wax
into this plaster mould and then making final correc-
tions on the wax cast, was Lysistratus of Sicyon,
the brother of Lysippus of whom we have spoken.
Indeed he introduced the practice of giving like-
