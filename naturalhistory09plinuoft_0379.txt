BOOK XXXV. xL. 143-146

Celebrating the Quinquatrus,‘1 and also a Nemesis of
great merit3 Theorus a Man Anointing Himself,
and also Orestes killing his Mother and Aegisthus,
and the Trojan W'ar in a series of pictures now in
Philippus' Porticoes at Rome and a Cassandra, in
the Shrine of Concord, a Leontion Epicurus’s mis-
tress in Contemplation, a King Demetrius3 Theon
a Madness of Orestes, 3 Thamyras the Harper;
Tauriscus a Man throwing 3 Quoit, 3 Clytaemnestra,
3 Young Pan, 3 Polynices Claiming the Son-ereigntyst
and 3 Capaneus.

Among these artists the following remarkable
case is not to be left out3 the man who ground the
colours for the painter Nealces, ErigonUS, attained
such proficiency on his own account that he actually
left behind him a famous pupil, Pasias, the brother
of the painter Aeginetas. It is also a very unusual
and memorable fact that the last works of artists
and their unfinished pictures such as the Iris of
Aristides‚⁶ the Tyndarus' Children d of Nicomachus,
the Medea of Timomachus and the Aphrodite of
Apelles which we have mentioned, are more admired §92
than those which they finished, because in thern are
seen the preliminary drawings left visible and the
artists’ actual thoughts, and in the midst of appi-oval's
beguilement we feel regret that the artist's hand
while engaged in the work was removed by death.

There are still some artists who are not undistin-
guished but who only need be mentioned in passing—-
Aristocydes, Anaxander, Aristobulus of Syria,
Arcesilas son of TisicrateS‚ Coroebus the pupil of

δ Of Thebes against his brother Eteocles.

⁶ See ξς 75, 98, 108, 111.

ἀ These were Castor, Polydeuces (Pollux), Helen, and
Clytaemnestra.
