a fine picture of Bacchants with Satyrs prowling
towards them, and a Scylla that is now in the Temple
of Peace in Rome. No other painter was ever a more
rapid worker. Indeed it is recorded that he accepted
a commission from the tyrant of Sicyon Aristi-atus
to paint by a given date a monument that he was

c. 355 [Mi.

erecting to the poet Telestes, and that he onl3 fl·c -539 ss-C-

arrived not long before the date3 the wrathful
tyrant threatened to punish him, but in a few da3s
he finished the work with 3 speed and an artistic
skill that were both remarkable. Among his pupils
were his brother Ariston and his son Aristides,‘z
and Philoxenus of Eretria, who painted for King
Cassander ¹⁷ a picture that holds the highest rank,
containing a battle between Alexander and Darius.
He also painted a picture with a wanton subject
showing three Sileni at their revels. Imitating the
rapidity of his master he introduced some shorthand
methods of painting, executed with still more
rapidity of technique.

With these artists is also reckoned Nicophanes,
an elegant and finished painter with whom few can be
compared for gracefulness‚ but who for tragic feeling
and weight of style is far from Zeuxis and Apelles.
Perseus, the pupil to whom Apelles dedicated his
volumes on the art of painting, had belonged to the
same period. Aristides ⁶ of Thebes also had as his
pupils his sons Niceros and Ariston,d the latter the
painter of a Satyr Crowned with a Wreath and
Holding a Goblet, · and other pupils of Aristides were
Antorides and E’Quphranor about the latter we
shall speak later on.
