nevertheless artists of repute: Antaeus, Callistratus,
Polycles of Athens, Callixenus, Pythocles‚ Pythias

third Cresilas’s, fourth Cydon’s a and fifth Phradmon‘s.

Pheidias, besides the Olympian Zeus, which Pkeidias.
nobody has ever rivalled, executed in ivory and gold 54⁹·

Athene which Aemilius Paulus dedicated in Rome 167 no?
